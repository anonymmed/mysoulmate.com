                <p>I want to talk about to things that are quite important to me. There are love and one my personal inadequacies. The thing is that I’m quite fond of love, I think that it’s a pretty all right deal. However, I’m going to have to admit that my emotional baggage has built up walls that not even a shock and awe campaign could bring down. But I do love. And in fact I even love unconditionally. <br><br>

                    I have a truck. It’s kind of a small truck, but I’m comfortable with myself so that’s okay. I think that I love it. I had a friend about a year ago ask me if I could have any car in the world what would I have. And aside from pointing out that my friend and I have clearly ran out of things to discuss and should probably go our separate ways, my answer told me that I love my truck (obviously I said I would keep my truck). </p>
